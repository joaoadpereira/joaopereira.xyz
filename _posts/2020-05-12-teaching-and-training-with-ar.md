This Hololens app shows how AR may be used to guide users in performing and learning potential new tasks. 


Share knowledge and the know-how is an essential process inside the industry to complete or solve difficult tasks. AR, through the disposal of digital holograms in the real world, may assist users in their daily operations.

Training and guidance in the industry with AR has become an important technology to speed up the learning process on maintenance, manufacturing processes and repeated processes. 

##### Solution

This Microsoft HoloLens app helps the user to disassemble the product and achieve the electronic components for possible maintenance, providing a step-by-step tutorial.  The app was designed up with [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity), [Vuforia](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia?cl1=AR_Vuforia_General_Google_CLC-cpc-ARBrandedxxxVuforiaUKNordics-38010&cmsrc=Google&cid=7015A000001oRiBQAU&elqCampaignId=13184&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIotbGw6aw6QIVxbUYCh03BgbdEAAYASAAEgJ7GvD_BwE) and deployed to [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens). 



Watch the video demo about the application recorded in first person experience:

The user is guided at the same time by 2 different ways: infocards (with written instructions) and holograms animations. To enable the next step, it is required that the user accepts the current step as completed. 

The colourful image works as image tracking (using Vuforia engine) for all holograms and fixed positions for the real tools. This allows each step  exactly simulates and highlights the right tools to use.
