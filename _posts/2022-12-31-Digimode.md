Using VR to demonstrate how a logistics service works. Show the value of the service to potential companies.    



This demo was developed as one of the outcomes from the [Digi-mode project](https://www.digi-mode.eu/). It aims to demonstrate how digital twins together with XR technologies can generate value for companies in different industry sectors. 


This demo was developed with [CoProtoLab](https://coprotolab.fi/), a service-design tool in VR that allows rapid development and simulation of services. It has an extensive 3D library for prototyping different industrial processes in VR and save templates for later use. It was developed with [Unity](https://unity.com/), [SteamVR](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). 


This project introduced new features to [CoProtoLab](https://coprotolab.fi/): a capability to prototype environments more realistic and add a service library that enables prototyping logistics services in the environment. For that, new buildings and natural elements were 3D modelled with Blender to achieve a more realistic demonstration. 


##### Results


Our work was developed together with [RL-Trans](https://rltrans.fi/), an international logistics company that was interested in creating a virtual experience to show their new bulk materials storage service. Some of the [RL-Trans](https://rltrans.fi/) operations can be visualized from the following video:

Several 3D models similiar to [RL-Trans](https://rltrans.fi/) buildings and trucks were developed to demonstrate the service in VR with [CoProtoLab](https://coprotolab.fi/). The following video shows the experience from the user point of view:

This digital-twin is one of the cases of [Digi-mode project](https://www.digi-mode.eu/) and it was presented to different companies in the region of Ostrobothnia, Finland.
