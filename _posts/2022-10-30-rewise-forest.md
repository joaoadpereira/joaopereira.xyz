Forest ecosystem in the future with VR. Demonstrating futuristic value chain.    



This demo was developed as one of the outcomes from the [REWISE project](https://www.muova.fi/projektit/rewise-tehosta-ekosysteemin-energiatehokkuutta-vr-prosessimallilla/). It aims to illustrate a value chain of forest industry and how it could operate and cooperate efficiently with different agents involved. 


This demo was developed with [CoProtoLab](https://coprotolab.fi/), a service-design tool in VR that allows rapid development and simulation of services. It has an extensive 3D library for prototyping different industrial processes in VR and save templates for later use. It was developed with [Unity](https://unity.com/), [SteamVR](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). 



##### Results


The user uses the right controller to select and navigate through different service moments. Different 3D models were developed to represent the processes and provide data to understand what can be done to decrease the environmental impact. 


This work was presented at [Subcontracting Trade Fair](https://www.alihankinta.fi/en/) in Tampere, 2022.  The user has a similar experience with the VR device as the following video:

<!--<p>-->



The demo served as an important facilitator to ignite discussions about smart solutions for the forest value chain and how XR technologies can have an important role to visualize simulations of future scenarios at large scale.
