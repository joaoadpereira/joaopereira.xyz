The challenge consisted in creating a future perspective of excavators operators in 20 years.


During an intensive 8 weeks, our team made a profound research in the field and completed many hours in machine operating observation at the Tampere Tram line construction (due to Novatron Oy involvement). We conducted an exhaustive questionnaire with professionals, excavators students and non-professionals to develop our out-of-box ideas.


Our multidisciplinary team, composed by professional and university students, came up with a prototype where future operators may have access in real-time to the 3D work site. From a remote office, they can interact with their hands with the terrain and create tasks that machines will automatically perform. In this way, operators focus on the tasks and may control several machines at the same time. Efficiency, save costs and security may be achieved in the worksite with this solution.


In this project was considered the great evolution of technology in the next 20 years, namely the large data communication, AR/VR and machinery/cabin evolution.
