Engineering work is mostly done in 3D CAD software throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products. Physics-Based Virtual Prototypes are very valuable addition on Computer Aided Engineering enabling product development simulators, training simulators and digital twin concept in product lift-cycle process. In this work, we present a framework, how such virtual prototypes can be developed from 3D CAD models with meaningful effort.
