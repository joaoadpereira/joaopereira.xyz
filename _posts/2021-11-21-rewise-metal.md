VR demo about future metal ecosystem. Demonstrate futuristic value chain.    



This demo was developed as one of the results from the [REWISE project](https://www.muova.fi/projektit/rewise-tehosta-ekosysteemin-energiatehokkuutta-vr-prosessimallilla/). It intends to illustrate a value chain of metal industry and how it could operate and cooperate efficiently with different agents involved. 


Different 3D models were developed and added to a gigantic map so the user can familiarized with the location of the ecosystem. With the use of gamification elements, the user visits different places and interacts with the virtual world to understand the role of different agents. With the left controller the user can move the joystick and select the location to move. The right controller provides the selection and interaction between different elements in the environment. Other visual and vibrational elements are triggered to the user after some task is performed. The demo was targeted to last between 5 to 10 minutes and show to high level managers how their decisions and changes can have a huge environmental impact. 



This demo was developed with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [SteamVR](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/). It was supported with environmental impact calculations performed with open source data from [openLCA](https://www.openlca.org/). 



##### Results

This work was presented at [Ostrobothnia fair](https://www.pohjanmaanteollisuus.fi/) in Seinäjoki, 2021 and [Vaasa EnergyWeek](https://www.energyweek.fi/), Vaasa 2022. The user has a similar experience with the VR device as the following video:

The demo served as an important facilitator to ignite discussions about smart solutions for the metal energy and how XR technologies can have an important role to visualize simulations of future scenarios at large scale.
