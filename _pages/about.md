Hello! Moi! Hola! Olá!

<!--I found out that Coronavirus became a common topic to break the ice before someone presents himself. Well, during these physical distance times, the use of AR & VR technologies also turned even more important digital solutions for business and people communicate remotely in an efficient way. Precisely, that's what I have been working on!--> 

I have been developing and researching XR applications to improve industrial processes in different domains: product design, simulation, training, manufacturing, marketing & sales and maintenance.  


To complement my skills, I've been participating in different courses related to Computer Science, Unity, C# programming, git, Blender and gamification.  


My background in Mechanical Engineering completes a deep knowledge of industrial digitalization with a focus on XR applications. 


<!--I am also passionate about football, bikepacking, hiking and padel. I'm also aboard member of Vierasjoukkue Club (Tampere), an international football team with players from over 15 different nations. -->
