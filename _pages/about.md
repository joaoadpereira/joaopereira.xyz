<!--*Hello! Moi! Olá! Hola!**-->

<!--I found out that Coronavirus became a common topic to break the ice before someone presents himself. Well, during these physical distance times, the use of AR & VR technologies also turned even more important digital solutions for business and people communicate remotely in an efficient way. Precisely, that's what I have been working on!--> 

I have been developing and researching XR applications to improve industrial processes in different domains: product design, simulation, training, manufacturing, marketing & sales and maintenance.  

My background in Mechanical Engineering completes a deep knowledge in industrial digitalization focused on XR applications. 

I am also passionate about football, bikepacking, hiking and (recently) padel.
