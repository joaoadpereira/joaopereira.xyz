<!--*Hello! Moi! Olá! Hola!**-->

I found out that Coronavirus became a common topic to break the ice before someone presents himself. Well, during these physical distance times, the use of AR & VR technologies also turned even more important digital solutions for business and people communicate remotely in an efficient way. Precisely, that's what I have been working on! 

I have been developing and researching XR apps to improve industrial processes in different domains: product design, simulation, training, manufacturing, marketing & sales and maintenance.  

I studied Mechanical Engineering in Portugal. Tired of the warm weather, beautiful beaches and amazing food, I became an exchange student in Finland. And it was soo amazing that I am still living here! Finland is really good. *apart of the darkness. and cold temperatures.*

Outside of a pandemic season, I enjoy to hang out with my friends, and share time together in sports, hiking, campfires, sauna and watching *The Office*. 



Oh! Minä opiskelen suomea!
